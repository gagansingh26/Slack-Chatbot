(This button is shown to period of time when OAuth Access token is valid. When token is expired, the button is hidden\n7.\tUser clicks Confirm Account Id.\n8.\tIt grabs from DocuSign available account Ids.\n9.\tUser selects account Id\n10.\tIt launches second integration. In this integration it configures DocuSign Connect component in DocuSign\n\n1.\tMake sure that correct type of DocuSign: sandbox pr prod is selected prior to clicking Authenticate button\n2.\tCheck that user clicked both buttons during setup process\n3.\tIn the process monitor - both integrations are completed successfully\n4.\tIf first integration wasn't started after it has been redirected back to Workday - check the redirect URL in the browser - it may have error message from DocuSign.\n5.\tMake sure that DocuSign Connect component is enabled in DocuSign\n6.\tUser must be admin\n7.\tIf user only clicks first button and doesn't click the second button (Confirm Account Id), it will still use the old account account Id.\n8.\tCurrently, SSO is not supported:  DOCENG-465 - Getting issue details... STATUS \n\n\nDocuSign Documents are taking hours to come back to Workday/stuck in Awaiting Integration Response for consecutive signing groups/document is not available in full process record\n•\tFrom our investigations, 99% of the time this is caused by DocuSign Connect not being set up in the tenant\n•\tEven if the customer claims Connect is Enabled, from experience, this is generally not the case so please double check this before brining the issue to Development.\n•\tIf running Update E-signature status task resolves the issue, it confirms the issue is likely related to Connect\n•\tIf you have Solas access, search for tenant name and DocuSign service - observe how many integration hits there are. Then search for \n\"Document was successfully signed\" - if there are no hits, it means DocuSign connect is not enabled.\n•\tIf you don't have Solas access, ask a DocEng developer to do this check for you\n•\tIf connect is the issue, ensure customer repeats steps 1-10 - It's very important to click the second button - Confirm Account ID\n•\tIf everything above looks fine: Consider checking whether the tenant has been moved from one data center to another using Environment Search\n•\tYou can ask the customer also to check their DocuSign account setup -  go settings, integrations, connect - their settings should look something like my DocuSign connect setup below\n \nHow to troubleshoot Adobe setup flow with OAuth\nTo do good troubleshooting, we need to learn first the flow. Actually it's similar to DocuSign (see \"How to troubleshoot DocuSign setup flow\").\n1.\tUser selects in the tenant setup to authenticate with Adobe.\n2.\tAfter Authenticate button is clicked, user enters Adobe credentials and it must redirect back to Workday.\n3.\tWhen it's redirected back to Workday, it must launch integration event which can be found in the process monitor\n4.\tThe purpose of this integration is to acquire OAuth Access token and Refresh Token from Adobe\n\n1.\tMake sure in the process monitor - that integration is completed successfully.\n2.\tIf the integration wasn't started after it has been redirected back to Workday - check the redirect URL in the browser - it may have error message from Adobe.\n3.\tIt's important to use the same credentials when re-authenticating because in-flight events are impacted. Different Adobe credentials can be linked to different Adobe account. When document was created in one Adobe account, it won't exist in another Adobe account. The symptom of this issue is error message we receive from Adobe: error message Agreement not found or Agreement is invalid.\n4.\tThe check box in the tenant setup - Is Adobe Configuration enabled - shows ON only when Adobe OAuth credentials are set. When Adobe integration key is available - the check box still is OFF but in this case it's still possible to run e-sign with Adobe. We need to implement ability to remove integration key from the system.\n5.\tIf user tries to run setup, but it doesn't ask for Adobe credentials and immediately redirects back to Workday, it means that current user is already logged-in into Adobe. The user must logoff from Adobe and then retry to Authenticate with Adobe again from the tenant setup.\n6.\tWe don't know which Adobe account is used when user authenticated with OAuth. It's still in our roadmap, but user can reach out to Adobe to get this information from them.\n7.\tIf the customer sees \"Please Wait...Connecting to Application\" - check the URL. There is usually a text string contained saying \"error=access_denied\" followed by a more detailed error message e.g. “Only admins can approve group scopes” so always copy the full URL into a text editor to see what the error is. These error messages come from Adobe, not Workday. Before raising a Jira or asking in our slack channel, please ensure the customer has first checked with Adobe as to why they are seeing the message. Often google searching the error message with Adobe at the start will reveal some possible explanations.\n8.\tCurrently, we do not support SSO with Adobe eSignature integration. We never tested such use case, so we do not support it either. Most probably it will not work for the same reason as DocuSign does not work with SSO.\n9.\tYou can view the history of authentication by selecting instance OAuth Consumer Token, 1$7501 and viewing audit entries of the instances there.\n10.\tIf the customer has not used Adobe in the past 60 days they would need re-authentication. That is the OAuth Token expiry duration.\n\nHow Adobe Sign Completion Email Notifications work\nPlease refer to the Admin Guide which explains Adobe Email Notifications in both Production and Non-Production Environments.\n\nHow to troubleshoot Adobe Distribute Documents appearing for some workers, while awaiting action for others\nA distribute document event will only show in workers inboxes when the background job is completed for all workers.\nIf it fails for one worker for any reason, it will not distribute to any workers.\nThis means a situation where a document is distributed to 100 workers and the customer reports 5 from the 100 workers did not receive the document generally is not possible and so far we have not observed any situation where this has happened.\nWe have had many jiras with examples like the above, the most common cause is that the customer is looking at who has signed, and while 95 workers have signed, 5 have not.\nThe customer then checks in workers Sandbox if the inbox item is there, and when it is not, they raise a case. \nThis is not a valid case, see section \"Why can't I see Adobe/DocuSign Events in SBOX inboxes?\" below for more details.\nIf you receive a case such as this, the only way to confirm that the worker does not have the inbox item is to \n•\tEither request a screenshot of the workers PROD inbox and archive\n•\tDo an OTS with the affected worker and observe the worker does not have the task\nFrom observation when we request this data from the customer, they close the case.\nOne other check to ensure that a document has not expired is below\n\n•\tOpen the Worker Distribution Event for the affected worker \n•\tFrom related actions off the event, navigate to 'Effective Stating > View Audit Entries' \n•\tFrom here, find eSignature Integration Configurable.has eSignature Signer (Abstract) relationship on the left, and do an instance view of E-Sign by Adobe Sign related instance\n•\tGo to Attributes tab, check if eSign Custom Status is EXPIRED - if so it means the document has been removed in Adobe - usually this is a customer setting\n•\tGo to Attributes tab, ensure Signer Email Address, Signer Signing URL and Signer Document Key are populated correctly\n\nHow to troubleshoot Adobe Distribute Documents stuck in processing state\n•\tCheck when the distribution kicked off in Workday\n•\tEnsure that none of the recipients signed the document in Adobe before the distribution completed - This can be done by the customer viewing their Adobe admin account and comparing the times. This can happen when signers \n\nHow to troubleshoot Adobe Distribute Documents failing after launching?\n•\tEnsure that the Admin is not distributing the document to themselves\n•\tEnsure that all recipients have a valid email (no duplicates, or fake/test mails such as  \"@gmail.com1\")\n•\tCheck that the file size is under 10 MB (this is the max default according to the Adobe site) \n\n\nHow to triage issue with missing e-signed document (Adobe Sign and DocuSign)\n1.\tIs signed document available in Full process record of the review document event \\ distribution event? If yes, it's rather a problem with Worker Profile. It can be due to security configuration.\n2.\tIf signed document is not available in full process record - check if signing was completed and inbox item was submitted by all signers.\n3.\tAre there any failures in integration events in review document event? If yes - investigate them. Check consolidated reports.\n4.\tHave you tried to run Update E-Signature Status task? If no document after running it - grab and analyze the latest integration event in review document event. This integration event should be created by this task\n5.\tIs \"document attached to the employee profile but the signed by and signature date section are missing\" - make sure that the worker has not only signed but also submitted the step\n6.\tIs document still available in Adobe\\DocuSign?\n7.\tEnsure there is a valid email address on the worker's account.\n\nWe got confirmation from Adobe on .edu email addresses \n\n\"Adobe confirmed that there are issues with the .edu e-mail accounts. If a user has got an Adobe Cloud account with the same e-mail this can't be controlled via any settings in an other account. Therefore we see the issues with the .edu accounts from time to time. The only existing workaround is to use a non .edu mail.\"\nIf a document is sent to a worker with this email address, as stated above, the only workaround is to use a different email address. This issue is not on Workdays side, rather with the Adobe account. \n\nHow to find out eSignature integration detail?\nSupport or Development users can use this task : View eSignature Status (Internal Only),  2997$10111 to further troubleshoot customer issues.\n\nSearch for the task either by entering the Instance Id (2997$10111) or task:view eSignature Status. If accessing from related action note that the task is not listed under business process menu item, but from event menu item:\n\n \nChoose the event that you are troubleshooting. Alternatively you could also run is as a related action off of the event.\nCheck each of the fields available in the view task. Some of the fields to note are:\n•\tSigner email address : Should be valid and not duplicate\n•\teSignature Integration Document Key: Should be valid. This is the transaction id on Adobe or DocuSign, also known as agreement id (Adobe) or envelope id (DocuSign)\n•\tSigner Signing URL : should be valid and pointing to the adobe Document cloud site.\n \nwhat if the review document step failed?\ncheck for error detail in full process record\n \nview eSignature status task also shows the integration error and the integration events launched for the review document step selected. So you could get into the integration event from this task directly instead of checking for the integration event launched after the step initiation from process monitor.\n \nscreenshot of the eSignature integration event:\n \n\nclick the number of errors to drill down into the error. Check the message to see the actual error detail.\nAs usual when raising a new Jira in case the error is not clear please attach the consolidated report(s), messages from the tab \"messages\", WID of review document event\\worker distribution event.\n\nHow to triage \"There are no documents to review at this time. Please click submit and continue.\" review document task?\nThis can be caused by either the Single Print for \"old\" doc gen or HTML to PDF job for Workday docs run failing, or a condition rule on the document inside the Review Document Step configuration not being met. \nIf its caused by Single Print or HTML to PDF run, investigate the error message. If its not clear how to proceed, use ask-print or raise a jira to PRINT team. \nHow to triage \"No Split message was generated\" error?\nWe have seen multiple cases of this issue in the past, and it usually occurs when a review document step is sent but the previous Generate Document Step print job failed.\nCheck that the review document instance has RL Review Document.reviews Repository Document (Abstract), 3$30295 with a Document in related instances \n \n\nEnsure that the Workflow Step instance view has a run as user, and the user is valid.\nThe run as user must not be terminated, inactive, disabled or locked at the time of run.\n\n\n \n\nTo check if the Single Print or HTML to PDF integration was successful, we can search in Process Monitor for Single Print or HTML to PDF Process with the date and time linked to the generate document step. Then instance view the request. If we see any failures here we can view the integration event and get the message. From here, search the message in jira/slack to see what the previous resolutions were, and if this belongs to PAPER or DOCENG project.\n \n\nHow to triage Failed to match any nodes for input-xpath error?\n•\tSame steps above, most often this is caused by Generate Document step failure with Adobe E-sign integration review document step.\n\nHow to triage \"Report design must be specified in request\" error?\n•\tGenerally this means the Review Document Step did not find the associated Generate Document Event. \no\tThis can be caused by parallel steps, or identical document names.\n\nHow to triage DocuSign Missing Anchor Text issue?\nNote that DOCENG can no longer triage cases for Missing Anchor texts for DocuSign\nUsing the Jira filter\nproject = \"Document Engineering\" AND text ~ \"missing anchor text\" AND type = Bug ORDER BY created DESC\nThere have been 35 jiras (as of 14 February 2024) raised and each time it has been a configuration issue. \nIf you have a case with this issue, use this filter and rule out each previous case before contacting DOCENG\n\tGo to Full Process Record of the event. (Parent event of the review document event should be used)\n\tGo to the \"Documents\" tab\n\tOpen the PDF and verify that anchor text tab is present\n\tIf the document is a generated document/Template then the anchor text would with white font color, to verify that this contains anchor text, copy the area in the PDF where the anchor text should be and paste the text in a notepad to verify.\n\tEnsure that the order (number) of the signing group is appended to the custom anchor text when you create the document.\nFor example, if your custom anchor text is signHerePlease, enter signHerePlease1 to mark the place you want the first (or only) signing group role to sign.

Customers need to configure document link expiration with a number of days according to company need, then relaunch or redistribute the documents. Ref: https://helpx.adobe.com/sign/using/adobesign-document-link-expiration.html\n\nFull Process Record of a Review Document Event shows 'Invalid Agreement ID' error message?\nIt means customers recently re-authenticated with a different Adobe account than the account that was when the review document was initiated. Either re-authenticate with a correct Adobe account again or just relaunch the review document event so that initiation is using the latest Adobe account.\n\nReview Documents with Adobe Sign Initiated in IMPL/Sandbox tenants are sent to Adobe production account even though there is no Adobe configured in the IMPL/Sandbox tenants?\nThe root cause is the customer is still using adobe integration key in production tenant (it is hidden now but functioning) that is copied automatically to IMPL/Sandbox tenant and used by review document initiation there.\nThe resolutions: \n1.\tAuthenticate with Adobe (demo/test account) in IMPL tenants before review document initations to avoid using integration key from production\n2.\tcustomer to run Remove eSignature Configuration+TG, 2997$19809 in production tenants, then remove Adobe integration key configuration (in this case customer needs to authenticate with adobe in production). The new IMPL tenants will not contain the integration key from production tenants\n\nWhy is the Condition Rule Tester showing a different evaluation to an event?\nRule tester uses current date as effective date, thats why it may give a different result from the actual result in generated document. \nOur framework allows the Apps team to pass in the effective date according to their BP.\n\nWhat does Permission Denied error mean for REST CANCEL DOCUMENT instruction?\nThe main reason for the error message is the adobe account used by customer is missing permission to delete document after cancelling the agreements. \n\nHow does Workday deal with third party applications e.g. Kainos, SMART, Menlo, etc.?\nIn our Admin guide, we have not documented usage with these applications.\nIf a customer is using Adobe/DocuSign with these applications it may not work as expected. \nDOCENG is not responsible for these applications if a customer has an issue when using our Product with them.\n\nAuthentication with Adobe or DocuSign failed Due to Missing OAuth Consumer Key and Consumer Secret?\nSymptoms: get error message \"{ “error”: “invalid_grant”, “error_description”: “unauthorized_client” }\"\nTo verify Consumer Key, test the MB: Directory Property@get eSign OAuth Consumer Key with OAuth Service Provider parm(GAS)*P*S[ramb]+PA, 86$802091\nTo verify Consumer Secret, test the MB: Directory Property@get eSign OAuth Consumer Secret with OAuth Service Provider parm(GAS)*P*S[ramb]+PA, 86$802090\nInput Parameter (OAuth Service Provider):\n•\tAdobe, 7524$45 (used by production account)\n•\tAdobe Acrobat Sign Sandbox, 7524$61 used by demo account)\n•\tAdobe_GovCloud, 7524$60 (Adobe FedRAMP, used only in FedRAMP ENVs)\n•\tDocuSign, 7524$21 (used by DocuSign demo/sandbox account)\n•\tDocuSign_Production, 7524$23 (used by DocuSign production account)\nThe Consumer Secret should have the similar format as the Customer Key. \nDo NOT post or save the results anywhere!!!\nCheck together with DOCENG Dev to determine whether the result is correct or not.\n\nCan Anchor text be used in Adobe e-Sign?\nYes - if Anchor text is not used, Adobe will generally add the signature field at the bottom of the document. \n\nIf a customer wants to specify where to add anchor text, they can use the tags below \nhttps://helpx.adobe.com/ie/sign/using/text-tag.html \n\nHow to triage \"Error:You are not authorized to sign this document. Please contact an administrator to the DocuSign account.\" ?\n•\tPlease instruct the customer (employee who signs the document), to logout of their personal DocuSign  account, clean cookies and browser cache. Than try again.\n•\tAssure, no SSO is used.\n•\tAdditionally, let the customer check, if the account they use to setup DocuSign in the tenant has Admin rights.\n\nHow to triage \"Internal Server Error. (id: VPS|xxx-xxx-xxx-xx-xxxxxx)\" ?\nThis is a generic error message thrown in the VPS page when something has gone wrong, as the error comes from VPS, they have better logging to investigate and advise on the exact issue, any occurrences of this issue should first be brought to them.\nAfter that, there is a number of reasons why we have seen this in the past:\nIf the issue is only happening for a few Review Document events - \n•\tA worker/candidate is trying to sign a document which has not yet been generated (wait 1-2 mins and try again)\n•\tA worker/candidate is trying to sign a document which has been removed/expired/cancelled - refresh and the option to sign may be gone\n•\tA worker/candidate has changed their email since the BP was started.\n\nIf the issue is happening for ALL Review Document Events\n•\tFor DocuSign, there may be a mismatch in the credentials that were used for Oauth vs DocuSign admin account\n•\tFor DocuSign, the customer may have hit their API limit and the call to DocuSign fails\n•\tFor Adobe/DocuSign, the refresh token may have expired or been revoked and customer will need to re-authenticate\n•\tFor DocuSign, they may need to update their API password as it can expire\n•\tFor both Adobe & DocuSign - SSO is not supported (this is documented in the Admin Guide), if SSO is being used it can cause issues. \n\nHow to triage Generate Document Step having \"Failed\" status?\n•\tGo to the Generate Document Event instance, right click - Effective Stating - Audit Entries\n•\tFind where the Changed Attribute Initialization Failed is set to Y, and click on the magnifying glass in the Recording Transaction\n•\tIn the next page, click the orange View Details button \n•\tScroll through the items and find where an error message has been added\n•\tAny error messages related to report configuration, CRF or CF configuration, dividing by 0, should be triaged by support\n•\tIf there is a different error, post it in the ask-docs channel\n\nHow to triage DocuSign error \"You are not authorized to sign this document. Please contact an administrator to verify the DocuSign account.\"?\nThis error occurs when a customer has kicked off an event with DocuSign in their DocuSign Production account (note - their DocuSign account, not Workday tenant) and then have switched to DocuSign Sandbox and attempted to sign a document.\nThis can also happen vice versa - initiating an event with DocuSign Sandbox, and then switching to DocuSign Production mid flight. \nThere is two resolutions:\n•\trelaunch the Review Document Event\n•\tThe Admin must switch back to the original DocuSign account \n\nHow to triage questions around Document Security?\nFirstly as a Development team, we will not be able to advise customers on how they should configure security on their tenant. These types of questions should be brought to implementers or security consultants.\nIf you believe you have found a bug in relation to Document Security, please replicate the issue locally and provide a snapshot. That way, the code can be traced to determine why a worker has or hasn't got access to a certain document.\nInside Workday, there are many reports that can be leveraged to help understand why a user has access to a document, see lists below. \nIf you are working regularly on security cases, its worth taking the \"Configurable Security Fundamentals - Learn Independent\" course.\nThese are the Workday delivered tasks and reports we as a Dev team use to triage security, as these are available if you run these first before contacting us you can likely solve the issue and save a lot of time for both teams.\n\nTest Domain Permissions for User, 2998$32269\nTest Security Group Membership, 2998$3095\nTest Security Group Type Configuration, 4297$5988\nCompare Permissions of Two Security Groups+TG, 2997$15050\nCompare Security of Two ~Worker~ Accounts+TG, 2997$15045\n\n \n\n \n\nTo address concerns regarding documents not being visible on the Worker profile, you may refer to Documents Security#670819326\n\nCustomer is using a bot to complete BP, and its no longer working\nIf customer is using a bot to complete multiple BPs and it begins to fail, ensure it is not being run too close to the maintenance window period. \nWe have seen cases in the past (e.g. DOCENG-7262) where this has caused the job to fall over.\n\nHow to triage Report inside Review Document Step, not showing desired output type? (e.g. pdf, xls)\nAfter configuring the Review Document Step, there will be an option to select Run as User, and configure desired report output.\nEnsure that the correct report output is selected, default is excel (see DOCENG-6929).\n\nRouting Modifier with e-signature (Adobe and DocuSign)\nAs per the Admin Guide \"Routing modifiers are not supported in the signature grid when configuring signature groups for the Review Documents step.\"\nIf customer uses Routing modifier, it does not honour the configuration, this is the current behaviour.\n\nReview Document task showing old or unexpected Gen Doc/Add Documents configuration based on current BP configuration\nThis can happen in certain circumstances where the step is referencing an old configuration.\nTo rule this out, remove the step from the BP, Save, then re-add the step with the desired configuration and re run the BP\n\nHow to triage DocuSign error \"The selected DocuSign account type (Production/Sandbox) on the Edit Tenant Setup - Business Process task doesn’t match your DocuSign access token. Ensure that the DocuSign integration is properly configured in the tenant and try again. For configuration instructions, see Set Up DocuSign in the Administrator Guide.\"\nErrors like the ones above can occur for the following reasons. For more information regarding DocuSign authentication, please refer to the admin guide. \n•\tThe customer either authenticates with a Sandbox account in their Production environment, but does not complete both steps.\n•\tThe customer authenticates with a Production account in their Production tenant, but does not complete both steps.\n•\tThe customer authenticated with a Production account in their Sandbox environment, but does not complete both steps.\n\nHow to triage DocuSign error \"The document has already been signed by another user. Please contact your Administrator for more information’ .\nThis error can occur if the associated envelope is deleted or voided.\n\nHow to triage error \"Unable to authorize access because the client configuration is invalid: Invalid_request’ .\nThis errors can occur if the EMS values are missing from the Tenant\n•\tThe first thing to do is to check if it's a new tenant. There is a possibility that the EMS value is not set.\n•\tYou can also search 86$657522 OAuth Service Provider@get OAuth Service Provider URL for Adobe(BA)*P[ramb]+PA+TG and click on the ''Test' button and select OAuth Service Provider 'Adobe' OR 'DocuSign' etc. and click OK. If the OAuth Service Provider URL is blank, the EMS value is missing.\n\nHow to triage error related to DocuSign Template ID\nThis error occurs when an invalid Template ID is used in the Review Document step.\n•\tINVALID_REQUEST_PARAMETER\nThe request contained at least one invalid parameter. Invalid value specified for 'templateId' in composite template sequence: 1\nThis error occurs when the Template ID used in the Review Document step is not associated with the authenticated DocuSign Account on the Tenant.\n•\tUSER_LACKS_MEMBERSHIP\nThe UserID does not have a valid membership in this Account. User is not an active member of the template's account.\nWhat to do if multiple customers in a specific data centre are reporting issues with Adobe or DocuSign not working?\nGenerally this can mean either an outage in the e-sign provider (for this check their status page) \nOR \nif the issue is reported first thing at the start of the week, it's likely a weekend maintenance window issue related to firewalls or services not being brought up.\nIn this case DOCENG will not be able to resolve the issue.\nCheck relevant slack channels to see if other issues have been reported - teams that are relevant include Techops, INF, VPS\n\nHow to triage error \"A background process that is required to generate the PDF failed. Try checking the process history or the background job monitor’ .\nThis error arises when document generation fails due to an error. If the customer is utilizing Workday Docs (using Drive Document), the issue should be assigned to the Workday Docs (WRTE) team for the initial triage or reach out to #ask-docs-for-bps.\nDocuSign API Limit \nDocuSign enforces API limits for Review & Distributed Document (also known as Bulk Send in DocuSign terms), which can be referenced at https://developers.docusign.com/platform/resource-limits/.\nFor a single document with one signer, Workday requires 4 API calls to create an envelope and check its status. Each additional signer will necessitate an additional API call on top of that.\nWorkday utilizes Rabbit MQ for processing integration events (API calls), and there isn't a specific mechanism in place at our application layer to manage hourly API limits or burst limits.\nIn the event that Workday encounters a BURST API LIMIT error from DocuSign, the corresponding Review Document Event will fail and can only be manually relaunched.\nFor questions regarding DocuSign API limits, the customer should reach out to DocuSign directly.\nSome issues customers have reported to us, and that we have then sent back to DocuSign include:\n{\"errorCode\":\"ENVELOPE_ALLOWANCE_EXCEEDED\",\"message\":\"The envelope allowance for the account has been exceeded.\"}\nIf customer gets this error in test/Demo accounts, they must contact DocuSign directly as DocuSign will block bulk envelopes on test accounts to stop fraud.\n\nAdobe Limits\nWhile Adobe does not document that they enforce any strict API limit, they have transaction/user limits associated with the type of enterprise account a customer may use.\nInformation on these limits can be found on the Adobe website below:\nhttps://helpx.adobe.com/sign/using/transaction-limits.html\nhttps://developer.adobe.com/document-services/docs/overview/limits/\nIf a customer wishes to increase an Adobe limit, they will need to contact Adobe.\nSome of the limits we have seen reported in the past include: \nPARTICIPANT_LIMIT_EXCEEDED - this is a limit imposed by Adobe on the number of singers allowed per document. Customer can contact Adobe if they need the limit increased.\nTHROTTLING_TOO_MANY_REQUESTS - this is a limit imposed by Adobe, often seen if a customer sends a large number of documents in a very short time.\n\nDocuSign Account ID not appearing in Confirm DocuSign Account ID\nThis issue was discovered with DOCENG-7727 - we will allow list the complete list provided by DocuSign.\nIn future, it's possible that DocuSign will add new sub domains that won't be covered, in this case if you see these symptoms please post in ask-docs and we can confirm via Solas and update the list.\n\nCRF Not Evaluating Correctly on Review Document Relaunch Using Workday Docs\nWhen a customer updates an existing Workday Document (Drive Document) using a CRF after the business process (BP) has been initiated, the CRF may not evaluate correctly upon relaunching the review document event. To ensure the CRF is evaluated correctly, the event must be rescinded, and the BP must be initiated again. This is how Workday Docs functions. However, if the customer only adds a static text to the document and then relaunches the review document, it may evaluate correctly in this case.\n\nDistribute Document with Adobe Sign sends unexpected email notification from Adobe\nContact Adobe support and request to suppress the email notifications for megasign, two settings has to be disbaled : SEND_PLEASE_SIGN_EMAIL and SEND_PLEASE_SIGN_EMAIL_TO_FIRST_SIGNER\n\nDocuSign Error USER_NOT_ACCOUNT_ADMIN\n If the customer encounters the error: \"USER_NOT_ACCOUNT_ADMIN\", \"message\": \"User is not an account administrator.\" while creating a DocuSign Connect Configuration, they need to contact DocuSign support to grant admin access to the user account used for authentication. This is not a Workday issue. Here are other DocuSign error codes; DocuSign support should be the first point of contact for these errors.\n\nDocuSign Error Code: UNKNOWN_ENVELOPE_RECIPIENT\nThis usually occurs if the customer or DocuSign voids or changes the envelope inside the DocuSign account. Customer will need to contact DocuSign support for more information.\n\nDocuSign Issue due to uppercase base URI\n If customers report a failure with DocuSign and we have confirmed that the root cause is a base URL containing capital letters (verified by checking the tenant or Solas), the recommended solution is to re-authenticate with DocuSign and Confirm Account ID again. This re-authentication process will automatically convert the base URL to lowercase, effectively resolving the issue.\n\nDocuSign Status Page\nhttps://status.docusign.com/\n\nAdobe Status Page\nhttps://status.adobe.com/cloud/document_cloud#/
